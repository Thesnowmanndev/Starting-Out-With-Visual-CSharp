# Starting Out With >> Visual C# - Fifth Edition

## Introduction

This repository is means to host my journey of working through Tony Gaddis's book Starting Out With >> Visual C# - Fifth Edition. This is a book I picked up after discovering another one of his titles regarding the Java programming language. Now that I am nearing completion of my Bachelors of Science - Computer Science (earned on 12-18-2022) I want to continue my life long educational journey. I believe learning how to make useful and beautiful windows applications will be a step in the right direction.
